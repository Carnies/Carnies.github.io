### Target Interception

**Description**: We have intercepted the target's location and have gained access to one of the cameras on site. Could you identify which city and country the target is located in? http://91.133.85.170:8090 ## Flag Format: FLAG{city_country} eg: FLAG{canberra_australia}

##### Solution:

The website is showing a live web camera image, but it was a bit hard for me to tell where it it:

Google "where is 91.133.85.179" and find out the ip address belong to Salzburg, Austria. And it is the answer for this question.
