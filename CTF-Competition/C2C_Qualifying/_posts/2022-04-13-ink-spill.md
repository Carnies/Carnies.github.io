### Ink Spill

**Description**: We have heard through InfoSec Twitter that famous and incredibly secretive hacker 1337MaliciousAttacker has accidentally leaked PII about himself by accidentally publishing a GitHub repo called private_info. It looks like he has made the repo to private now but everyone knows the saying "The Internet is Written in Ink". Can you find famous and incredibly secretive hacker 1337MaliciousAttacker's credit card number?

##### Solution:

First find the url address of the user on Github, and then use Wayback Machine to find the historic information in its archive:

The credit card we're looking is just in the past commit.
