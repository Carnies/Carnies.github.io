### Beach Detective

**Description**: A member of the public sent the NSW Police this photo taken from a bridge as to the the last place they saw a criminal. After seeing the criminal walked along this path to the beach, the criminal robbed several houses in the area. The only detail that could be pointed out was that they wore suspenders. The owner of a local refreshment store could have been another witness - can you please provide the mobile phone number of the witness?

**Hints**: 
- I wonder how many beaches suspension bridges are in NSW?
- Social media will help finding the witness
- We are looking for a mobile phone number

##### Solution:

With the hints, searching for suspension bridge and beaches in Sydney, it didn't take long to narrow down my research to Parsley Bay. There's only one store close to the beach, called "Parsley Bay Cafe". It was easy to find their landline number, but to find the right mobile phone number, it was a real pain. 

In all, I found out three mobile numbers before finally got the right one:

And the correct answer was the one in facebook page.
