### Bravo Six, Going Dark

**Description**: We just received a notification from a Facebook content reviewer. Apparently a livestream involved a drone scoping out what appears to be a location for potential robbery. They shut down the stream but were only able to save the Thumbnail snippet. The GPS metadata was stripped so we have no idea which country let alone state it may have occurred in. Can you please review the footage and determine the exact street number and name where the drone was flying over? Flag Format is FLAG{## streetname}

##### Solution:

The video is about the drone falling (why drone again...)

There're two frames that I found useful: on the left of the image below, there's a logo with wordings like "selvatica":

The other one shows a telephone number: "9354 1700"

Combine the two information together, the address for the building in the middle can be decided. "Selvatica" is on 54 Gaffney St while "03 9354 1700" is for Matrix Fitness on 50 Gaffney St, so the one we're looking for is on 52 Gaffney St.
