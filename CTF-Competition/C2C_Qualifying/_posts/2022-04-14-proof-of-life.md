### Proof of Life

**Description**: A child has run away from home and sent this image to his family via Dropbox to show that he is OK! They can't seem to see anything in the photo though. Can you use your detective skills to find the street this photo was taken on? Flag Format (all lowercase) - flag{streetname_st}
