### Postbook

This is also a website for posting pages like in Micro-CMSv1, with additional function to view others' postings.

##### Flag 3.1

Tried to sign up with username "admin", but there was no the user named "admin" exist before. However, in the homepage, it can be seen that there's another named "user". I unintentionally tried to log in to that account with the stupidest password ever exist, "password", and it succeeded! Got my first flag of this question.

##### Flag 3.2

When creating a new post, it can be seen from the source code there was one field called "user_id" was hidden:

Try changing the id to a number other than 3 and post, then the second flag is found:

##### Flag 3.3

After creating a new page, it can be seen that the id for the page was 4.

So I changed the id to discover other pages and found out the flag with id=2:

##### Flag 3.4

This is one step further from the last flag. By manipulating the url, not only can we view other's private posts, but can also change them. By opening the page "Hello everyone" created by "user", replacing "view" by "edit" in the url and making some changes to the content, then the fourth flag was revealed.

##### Flag 3.5

I have to admit that I obtained the following 3 flags with the help of hints. The hints are:

```
- 189 * 5

- The cookie allows you to stay signed in. Can you figure out how they work so you can sign in to user with ID 1?

 - Deleting a post seems to take an ID that is not a number. Can you figure out what it is?
```

**Update**: By that time, I could not think of a way to capture this flag without the hint. Later, when I learnt how to use Burpsuite, this can actually be done by utilizing its **Intruder** module, marking the id as position and iterating payload as a sequence of numbers.

##### Flag 3.6

By looking at the cookie id value, I could not tell how the value is derived. It could either be hex value, encoding or hashing. 

![Postbook_09](/assets/Postbook_09.png)

I considered asking my best friend, Google, and as expected, it did not fail me:

![Postbook_10](/assets/Postbook_10.png)

So I run `echo -n 1 | md5sum` to obtain the hash value of 1 and put it into cookie value. The next flag is then shown on the index page.

##### Flag 3.7

First, I deleted a page that I created to see how the http request is composed. Similar to the exercise above, the page id to be deleted is represented by the MD5 hash value.

![Postbook_12](/assets/Postbook_12.png)

So I replaced the id in url by the hash value of the id belonging to a page that was created by another user and got my final flag for this question.
