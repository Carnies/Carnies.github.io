### Micro CMS v1


This is a website to create and view blogs. I've tried a few things first:

- browse the existing website while checking its source code
- click all available buttons to see what functions available are available
- try if XSS works -> this helps give me the [first](#flag-2.1) and [second](#flag-2.2) flag
- try SQLi in url or search field -> gives me the [third](#flag-23)

##### Flag 2.1

There's one sentence on the page saying "Markdown is supported, but scripts are not". It was true that the `<scripts>` tag in the body of the blog will be replaced by `<scrubbed>` so XSS would not work, however the scripting on the title of the blog remain unchanged.

When going back to the homepage, where the title of the blog should be shown, the XXS attack works and the flag is shown:

##### Flag 2.2

Similar to the wargame we practiced in the course, scripting is not the sole way to inject XSS attack. With reference to the cheat sheet listed below, including either `onload` or `onerror` in the blog's body would succeed and show the flag

##### Flag 2.3

As there's no search field in the page, the only possible way to put a SQLi I could come up with would be in the url, and it does work

##### Flag 2.4

The final flag took me a while, so I asked for the hints:
```
- Try creating a new page
- How are pages indexed?
```
Then I realize that the blog I created was indexed from 8. By changing the number from 1, I was able to discover the private page with index 6, and the flag is in the body of the page.
